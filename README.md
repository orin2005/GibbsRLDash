# GibbsRLDash

This is a platformer game that was written in Java using the JavaFX library. 

I really enjoy what Gibbs does for the Rocket League community, and this is my somewhat tribute to how much I enjoy watching his videos. This game is free, and I plan on making all my code opensource to promote opensource game productions. I will hopefully by the end of this have everything well documented as well, to allow many people to take the game and write their own code to the game.
